# Project Overview
The Cardio Wellness Programme is a comprehensive data-driven approach to predict cardiovascular disease risk. Using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, this project transforms raw health-related data into meaningful insights to help in early detection and prevention of heart-related issues.

# Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing health-related attributes such as:
Height, Weight, BMI
Alcohol and dietary consumption
Physical activity and smoking history
Medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, etc.

# Preprocessing Steps
Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates and missing values.
Standardized and normalized numeric values.
Encoding:
Applied one-hot and label encoding to categorical variables.
Feature Scaling:
Used MinMaxScaler to normalize numeric columns.

# Features
Key features used in the project include:
Health metrics: BMI, diet, and exercise patterns.
Medical history: Diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.
Demographics: Age and gender.
Tools and Libraries
The project uses the following tools:

# Programming Language:
Python
# Libraries:
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation
Scikit-learn: Preprocessing and scaling
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Visualization
Jupyter Notebook: Development
